## My process

### Built with

- Vite development server and builder
- pnpm
- Tailwind
- Prettier with `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` to autosort class names
- Semantic HTML markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've not used Figma much so it was mostly learning how to extract information from this. Despite seeing values of the box shadow Figma was displaying with a much sharper shadow. Figma has been in the Tech news lately due to being aquired by Abobe and engaging in some "Dark Arts" practices such as no locked seating causing unexpected bill increases.

### Continued development

This being the first challenge it doesn't make sense to pull the challenges into a monorepo but this is a long term goal as I complete these.
